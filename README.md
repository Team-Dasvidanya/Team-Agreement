# Team-Agreement
Team agreement for our Code 201 final project.


## Conflict Plan

Meeting everday. Start off meeting with hello, situation report, and then follow by addressing any conflicts.

#### What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Dispute about code writing - put to a vote. Majority rule. JB as tiebreaker.
Everyday meeting will allow time to address any conflicts. Group mediation.


#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

1. How's it going? How're you doing?
2. Is this a coding or personal issue?
3. If code, TA assistance / possible emergency meeting.
4. Plan/delegation adjustments


#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If concerns about contribution are brought up and have to shift our plan 2-3 times, this will trigger escalation.  

## Communication Plan

#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- Slack (we all have push notifications)
- Remo (virtual meetups)

#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Every morning we start with a group meeting to share greetings and say hello, followed by a review of our assigned tasks, and we also provide time for addressing any conflicts.

Communication Manager: Tim Egorov  

#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
It's the communication manager's job to ensure the safe environment and encourage participation from all group members.

## Work Plan

#### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Daily review of tasks. Members bring up tasks they might have uncovered and redelegate the workload if needed.

Initially, we will agree upon an MVP and focus on building out the core tasks first.

We will be using Trello board to track all of our work. In the morning meeting we will review our project status and the project manager will drive and clean up the space if needed. All task details will live in Trello.

Project Manager: Daniel Haugen

#### What project management tool will be used?
Trello

## Git Process

#### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

All finished components will live in github. 

#### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
We've created an organization that includes all members of our team. Here we can see all of our work. 

#### What is your Git flow?

PR at the end of the day for what you worked on.

Merge as a group the next morning.
Group `git pull`


#### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
#### How many people must review a PR?

Merging to the origin main will require everyone to review.
Merging to a branch will require only 2 members.

#### Who merges PRs?

Not the person who did the PR.

#### How often will you merge?

Daily merges unless something comes up.

#### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

Daily standup merging as a group.
Outside of daily standup, communicate via Slack.
